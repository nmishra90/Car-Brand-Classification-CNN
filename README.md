Studies on car styling have received much research attention recently due to its significance in presenting the brand identity and its influence to customers’ decisions.  Most of previous works focus on analysis of the stylistic features such as lines and shapes extracted by experts. By calculating pre-defined geometric quantities (e.g., length and curvature) of the stylistic features, they can be related to certain semantics.

Here I have used densenet network to classify. •	DenseNet Model analyse the image, then prediction is showcased on the Flask UI. It is very similar to a ResNet with some-fundamental differences. ResNet is using an additive method that means they take a previous output as an input for a future layer, & in DenseNet takes all previous output as an input for a future layer. So DenseNet was specially developed to improve accuracy caused by the vanishing gradient in high-level neural networks due to the long distance between input and output layers & the information vanishes before reaching its destination.

Web Design of the Model :-
